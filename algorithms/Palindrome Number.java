// Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

// click to show spoilers.

// Some hints:
// Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

// If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

// You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

// There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
